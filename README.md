# Real-Time Ads Recommendation System (T5 + Milvus + XGBoost)

###  Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-time ads recommendation pipeline** that simulates end-to-end personalization using **T5 embeddings for semantic retrieval** and **XGBoost for ranking**. The system mirrors production-style architecture using synthetic user-ad interaction data.

It integrates real-time components, ranking models, vector search, and scalable inference to illustrate how platforms like marketplaces or ad servers deliver personalized content in milliseconds.

### üîç Key Features

-  **Real-time data simulation** with user and ad streams  
-  **Embedding generation** using pre-trained T5  
-  **Semantic retrieval** using Milvus (vector database)  
-  **Ranking** with XGBoost (CTR-style scoring)  
-  **Model serving** with FastAPI and Triton Inference Server  
-  **Visualization** of ranked ads via Streamlit UI  
-  **Containerized deployment** using Docker + Docker Compose

###  System Architecture

```
[Simulated Data] ‚Üí [T5 Embeddings] ‚Üí [Milvus Retrieval] ‚Üí [XGBoost Reranker] ‚Üí [FastAPI API] ‚Üí [Streamlit UI]
```

1. **Data Ingestion**: Simulates user + ad interactions  
2. **Embedding Layer**: Uses T5 model to embed ads  
3. **Candidate Retrieval**: Milvus returns top-k ads via vector similarity  
4. **Re-ranking**: XGBoost scores and sorts ads based on relevance  
5. **Serving**: FastAPI endpoint delivers ranked ads  
6. **Visualization**: Streamlit app displays final results

###  Why This Matters

This project simulates what real-world ad tech and personalization systems look like ‚Äî from embedding-based retrieval to re-ranking and real-time serving.  
It‚Äôs a practical sandbox for ML engineers exploring **retrieval-augmented ranking**, **streaming recommendations**, and **low-latency inference pipelines**.
